Here is a clear and insightful summary of the analytics request:\n\nProduct Manager Darren Plutchock requires an analysis to track active user trends on the Priority Engine platform over the last three months, with a primary focus on the financial industry. The goal is to understand user engagement patterns and provide a flexible dataset for further exploration by the product team, delivered by next Thursday.\n\n*   **Core Metric:** The analysis will measure active users, defined specifically as user logins, over the past three months.\n*   **Segmentation:** The report must be filterable by industry (with a focus on Financial), market tax segments, user roles, regions, and product tiers.\n*   **Deliverable:** The final output is an Excel spreadsheet that combines and reconciles data from Priority Engine analytics, BigQuery, and potentially Pendo.\n\n**Level of Effort:** Medium. The request requires integrating data from up to three distinct sources and building a flexible, multi-filter spreadsheet, which adds complexity beyond a simple data pull.",
