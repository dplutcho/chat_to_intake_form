The primary goal is to provide a clear, visual understanding of user engagement segmented by specific user roles, enabling the marketing team to tailor their strategies more effectively before the end of next Thursday.\n\n*   **Core Visualization:** A line graph showing daily active users over the past three months.\n*   **Key Functionality:** The ability to dynamically segment and filter the entire dashboard by user role.\n*   **Data Requirement:** The underlying data must be refreshed automatically on a daily basis.\n\n**Level of Effort: Low.** This assumes that the definitions for \"active user\" and \"user role\" are already established and the data is readily available.",
